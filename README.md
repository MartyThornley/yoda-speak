# yoda-speak
WordPress plugin that translates text to Yoda speak

Uses a free API from http://www.yodaspeak.co.uk/

Please be respectful of their server. This is a fun way to learn using API's and is not meant to actually be used on live sites.

# To Use
Uses Mashape, so you will need an account there.

Find your Mashape API key and replace YOUR_MASHAPE_API_KEY_HERE a the top of the file.

Currently it adds a message to the dashboard and filters the content to replace all content with Yoda speak.
